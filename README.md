# 📚 SQL Developer Internship – Task: Creating Views (LibraryDB)

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to **learn how to create and use SQL Views** in a relational database.  
Views help in simplifying complex queries, providing data abstraction, ensuring security, and enabling reusable SQL logic.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** MySQL (LibraryDB schema)  
- **Tool Used:** MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite  
- **Concepts:** Views, Joins, Aggregations, Data Abstraction

---

## 📂 Deliverables
This repository contains:
- `views.sql` → SQL script defining and testing different views
- `README.md` → Explanation of the objective, approach, and outcomes
- (Optional) `screenshots/` → Execution outputs (if any)

Got it 👍 Here’s a neat version of **Task Activities, Learning Outcomes, and Learning Summary** you can directly add to your README or submission:

---

## 📝 Task Activities

* Designed and created multiple SQL views (`book_issue_details`, `member_contact`, `books_per_author`) in **LibraryDB**.
* Practiced **JOIN operations** inside views to combine data from multiple tables.
* Updated data using a view (`member_contact`) to understand updatable views.
* Used **aggregations** in views (`COUNT` per author).
* Dropped a view (`books_per_author`) to test removal and recreation.

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience in creating, querying, and dropping SQL views.
* Learned how views simplify complex queries and ensure **data abstraction**.
* Understood the conditions under which views are **updatable**.
* Practiced using **aggregate functions** within views for reporting.

## 📘 Learning Summary

This task strengthened my knowledge of **SQL views** as a tool for abstraction and reusable logic.
I learned how views improve **query simplicity, security, and database efficiency**.
